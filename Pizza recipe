Special equipment:
A pizza stone, highly recommended if you want crispy pizza crust

MAKING THE PIZZA DOUGH
1 Proof the yeast: Place the warm water in the large bowl of a heavy duty stand mixer. Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water 
and let it sit for 5 minutes until the yeast is dissolved.

2 Make and knead the pizza dough: Using the mixing paddle attachment, mix in the flour, salt, sugar, 
and olive oil on low speed for a minute. Then replace the mixing paddle with the dough hook attachment.
Knead the pizza dough on low to medium speed using the dough hook about 7-10 minutes.

3 Let the dough rise: Spread a thin layer of olive oil over the inside of a large bowl. 
Place the pizza dough in the bowl and turn it around so that it gets coated with the oil.
